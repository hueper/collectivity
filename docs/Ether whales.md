# Ether whales

> However, there is a high degree of wealth concentration among cryptocurrency holders: over 30% of all Ether and over 20% of all Bitcoin is controlled by a small number of individual agents, called 'whales.'
> We define whales as the top 500 holders of cryptocurrency, excluding services, who store their holdings off exchanges. Distinguishing the whales from services is the most difficult step in this analysis, and can only be done with yearsâ€™ worth of blockchain data that has been linked to real-world entities. As of May 1, 2019, of the top 500 largest holders, 124 were services, and the remaining 376 were individual whales. We found that these 376 whales control 33% of the circulating supply in 2019, down from 47% in 2016.
