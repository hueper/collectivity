# RadicalxChange

https://www.radicalxchange.org/

> RadicalxChange (RxC) is a global movement for next-generation political economies. Weâ€™re committed to advancing plurality, equality, community, and decentralization through upgrading democracy, markets, the data economy, the commons, and identity.
>
> Founded by economist Glen Weyl in 2018, the RadicalxChange Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to advancing the RxC movement, to building community, and to education about democratic innovation.
>
> RxC connects people from all walks of life - ranging from social scientists and technologists to artists and activists. The movement is ever-evolving and we always welcome new people and ideas to make our social world more diverse, equal, and free.
